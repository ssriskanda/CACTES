## Sindu's personal analysis

Taking stuff from earlier but then addressing questions that may be in interest to us

**Does the district you live in impact your COVID knowledge score**

```{r}
Masaka_data <- subset(data, District == "MASAKA")
Kalungu_data <- subset(data, District == "KALUNGU")

t.test(Masaka_data$knowledge_score, Kalungu_data$knowledge_score)

#average Maska knowledge score
print(mean(Masaka_data$knowledge_score))

#average Kalungu knowledge score
print(mean(Kalungu_data$knowledge_score))

```

Assuming significance at the 5% level, district you live in does not impact the knowledge score. However, it is signitificant at the 10% level. Those living in Masaka have a higher score compared to Kalungu. Kalungu has about 27 households that have transportation as their occupation compared to Masaka's 8 households

**Does gender impact COVID knowledge score?** 
```{r}
Male_data <- subset(data, Female == "Male")
Female_data <- subset(data, Female == "Female")

t.test(Male_data$knowledge_score, Female_data$knowledge_score)
```

Assuming significance at the 5% level, gender does not impact the knowledge score

**What could impact COVID knowledge score**

```{r}
knowledge.glm <- lm(knowledge_score ~ District + Female + Age_of_Respondent + Q3 + Q6 + Quantile + Q16 + Q22 + Q23.1 + agriculture + transportation + education + sponsership + construction + business + trade + government + law + health + food + other + Q29, data = data )

output <- kable(coef(summary(knowledge.glm)), digits = c(3,3,3,3))
print(output)

```
